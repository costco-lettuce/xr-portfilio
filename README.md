# Welcome to Xavier's Github Portfolio

This folder contains final product presentations,
conference agendas, additional descriptions for
research experience, as well as my proposed degree 
plan for graduate school*.

## Structure
The files are categorized and numbered as follows:
- A: academic
- R: research
- V: volunteering

Each unique item in each category is assigned a
number. If there are no associated documents, the 
number is an integer, i.e., X1, X2,...

If there are associated documents like role
responsibilities or presentations, they will
be in the form X1.0, X1.1,...

## Descriptions
The .txt files (research and volunteering) 
elaborate on some of my duties and responsibilities
for their respective roles.

The .pdf files (presentations) are the full,
copied versions for their respective research
presentations or conference agendas.

The rabbit rescue .txt file showcases the impact
and heavy influence I have in the communities I've
been a part of.

## Note
*I will be attending graduate school with a full
time course load in an online format, but that
is the only sense I am "full time". I plan to
graduate in fall 2026.
