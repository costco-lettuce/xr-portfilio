# Welcome to Xavi's Github Portfolio

## About me:)
Hi everyone, my name is Xavier Rios, but I just go
by Xavi. I'm a data scientist and math graduate student.

I have a strong drive to overcome obstacles, venture into 
something new, and enjoy the struggle of the learning process. 
I use my strong programming (R, Python, SQL) and statistics 
background to address complex challenges like those in
public safety and health. Current research projects include
simulation and applications of stochastic differential equations.

My academic journey started with an undergraduate degree in statistics 
where I graduated summa cum laude. I returned to my undergraduate
university and I am working on a master's degree in mathematics with a 
concentration in statistics funded by the NSF S-STEM program, aiming to 
graduate in 2026.

Outside of my professional and academic careers, I'm a dedicated volunteer, 
foster parent, and activist for house rabbits and plan to found a 501c3 
non-profit dedicated to house rabbit and other small animal rescue, education, 
and awareness.

## Portfolio Information
This folder contains final product presentations,
conference agendas, additional descriptions for
research experience, as well as my proposed degree 
plan for graduate school*.

### Structure
The files are categorized and numbered as follows:
- A: academic
- R: research
- V: volunteering

Each unique item in each category is assigned a
number. If there are no associated documents, the 
number is an integer, i.e., X1, X2,...

If there are associated documents like role
responsibilities or presentations, they will
be in the form X1.0, X1.1,...

### Descriptions
The .txt files (research and volunteering) 
elaborate on some of my duties and responsibilities
for their respective roles.

The .pdf files (presentations) are the full,
copied versions for their respective research
presentations or conference agendas.

The rabbit rescue .txt file showcases the impact
and heavy influence I have in the communities I've
been a part of.

## Note
*I will be attending graduate school with a full
time course load in an online format, but that
is the only sense I am "full time".
