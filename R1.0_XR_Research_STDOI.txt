Undergraduate Research Assistant: July 2020 -- December 2020

- Collaborated with doctors to build predictive classification model in IBM SPSS to detect early onset type 2 diabetes
- Using backward step-wise logistic regression, identified best variables to use from high dimension public NHANES dataset
- Took non-invasive clinical measurements and carefully tested different weights for these values to determine best boundary cut-off point for our classification model
- Further tested cut-off point for classification comparing specificity versus sensitivity and opted for a higher false positive rate so more diabetics could be captured
- Forecasted that clinics could save up to 50% on testing procedures with use of our model versus current methods
